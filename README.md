# 2017_Spring_Marketing-Analytics-using-SAS
This is Dr. Mike Grigsby's class, one of my favorite classes. The purpose of the class is to use predictive analytics to get marketing insights. 
The dataset "tgif.csv" is the source from TGI Friday, a chain restaurant. I use Latent Gold to do segmentation and get , use SAS to do price elasticity and market basket analysis (MBA). I also give E-mail strategy which Dr. Grigsby says no one else has ever found this insight. 
This is a group project but I was marked as a star member because all other group members agreed that I made most of the analysis and got most of the insights. 
The project is graded 95.
