# 2017_Spring_Marketing-Analytics-using-SAS
This is Dr. Mike Grigsby's class, one of my favorite classes. The purpose of the class is to use predictive analytics to get marketing insights. 
The dataset is from TGI Friday, a chain restaurant. I use Latent Gold to do segmentation, use SAS to do price elasticity and market basket analysis (MBA), I also give E-mail strategy which Dr. Grigsby said no one else ever found this insight. 
This is a group project but I was marked as a star member because all other group members agreed that I did most of the analysis and got most of the insights. 
The project is graded 95.
