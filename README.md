# 2017_Spring_Marketing-Analytics-using-SAS
This is Dr. Mike Grigsby's class, one of my favorite classes. Dr. Grigsby is the author of two books you can find on Amazon, "Marketing Analytics" and "Advanced Customer Analytics". The purpose of the class is to use predictive analytics to get marketing insights. 

The source data is a CSV from a chain restaurant but I can not upload here. I use LatentGold to do segmentation and get "newclus4.xlsx" which gives each customer a cluster # (I can not upload here), the file "Porfile.xlsx" is extracted from LatentGOLD. Then I use SAS to try as many analytics as possible and summarize in the file "SAS code_result.xlsx" which is my experiment trying to do OLS regression, Logit, Poisson, price elasticity, market basket analysis (MBA), Days_btn_trans., ...etc. Each worksheet in the file is a analytic trying to find something, in each worksheet the SAS code is on the upper-left corner in orange color area. In my final presentation report "presentation.pdf", I just put some of the most important insights for the 10-minute presentation.    

I also generate an E-mail strategy which Dr. Grigsby says it is beautifule and very few people can find this insight. 

This is a group project but I was marked as a star member because all other members agreed that I made most of the analysis and found most of the insights. 
The project is graded 95.
