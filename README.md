# 2017_Spring_Marketing-Analytics-using-SAS
This is Dr. Mike Grigsby's class, one of my favorite classes. The purpose of the class is to use predictive analytics to get marketing insights. 
The dataset "tgif.csv" is the source from TGI Friday, a chain restaurant. I use Latent Gold to do segmentation and get "TGIF_newclus4.xlsx" which gives each customer a cluster #, the file "Porfile.xlsx" is extracted from LatentGOLD. Then I use SAS to try as many analytics as possible and summarize in the file "SAS code_Result_TGIF.xlsx" which is my experiment trying to do OLS regression, Logit, Poisson, price elasticity, market basket analysis (MBA), Days_btn_trans., ...etc. Each worksheet in the file is a analytic trying to find something, in each worksheet the SAS code is on the upper-left corner in orange color area. In my final PPT report "TGI_presentation_Group2_v13.PPT", I just put some of the analytics and results in "SAS code_Result_TGIF.xlsx" the presenttaion.     
I also give E-mail strategy which Dr. Grigsby says no one else has ever found this insight. 
This is a group project but I was marked as a star member because all other group members agreed that I made most of the analysis and got most of the insights. 
The project is graded 95.
